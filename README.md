# Spotify-music-recommendation-system
Welcome to the Spotify Music Recommendation System! This project demonstrates a music recommendation system built using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system is deployed using Flask for the backend API and Streamlit for the user interface. The model leverages a dataset of 30,000 songs with various features to recommend songs based on user input.
